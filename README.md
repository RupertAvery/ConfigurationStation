# ConfigurationStation

A tool for generating and updating `es_systems.cfg` for EmulationStation with RetroArch cores.

# Prerequisites

* EmulationStation
* RetroArch

# Usage

ConfigurationStation will look for your `%USERPROFILE%\.emulationstation` folder and `%AppData%\Roaming\RetroArch`. You can then select 
which systems you want to be available for EmulationStation. Finally, you can select the folders where the ROMs can be found.

RetroArch will download any missing cores for you, based on your selected systems.

# TODO

* Add advanced mode for manually setting up systems.
